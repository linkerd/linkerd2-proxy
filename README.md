This repo contains the transparent proxy component of [Linkerd2][linkerd2].
While the Linkerd2 proxy is heavily influenced by [the Linkerd 1.X
proxy][linkerd1], it comprises an entirely new codebase implemented in the
[Rust programming language][rust].

This proxy's features include:

* Transparent, zero-config proxying for HTTP, HTTP/2, and arbitrary TCP protocols.
* Automatic [Prometheus][prom] metrics export for HTTP and TCP traffic;
* Transparent, zero-config WebSocket proxying;
* Automatic, latency-aware, layer-7 [load balancing][loadbalancing];
* Automatic layer-4 load balancing for non-HTTP traffic;
* Automatic TLS (experimental);
* An on-demand diagnostic `tap` API.

This proxy is primarily intended to run on Linux in containerized
environments like [Kubernetes][k8s], though it may also work on other
Unix-like systems (like macOS).

The proxy supports service discovery via DNS and the [linkerd2
`Destination` gRPC API][linkerd2-proxy-api].

The Linkerd project is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
([CNCF][cncf]).


## Building the project

A `Makefile` is provided to automate most build tasks. It provides the
following targets:

* `make build` -- Compiles the proxy on your local system using `cargo`
* `make clean` -- Cleans the build target on the local system using `cargo clean`
* `make test` -- Runs unit and integration tests on your local system using `cargo`
* `make test-flakey` -- Runs _all_ tests, including those that may fail spuriously
* `make package` -- Builds a tarball at
  `target/release/linkerd2-proxy-${PACKAGE_VERSION}.tar.gz`. If
  `PACKAGE_VERSION` is not set in the environment, the local git SHA is used.
* `make docker` -- Builds a Docker container image that can be used for testing.
   If the `DOCKER_TAG` environment variable is set, the image is given this
   name. Otherwise, the image is not named.

### Cargo

Usually, [Cargo][cargo], Rust's package manager, is used to build and test this
project. If you don't have Cargo installed, we suggest getting it via
https://rustup.rs/.

## Artifacts

Each version of the _master_ branch is published to
`build.l5d.io/linkerd2-proxy/linkerd2-proxy-$PACKAGE_VERSION.tar.gz`. The most recent
version (and the package's SHA256 sum) can be discovered via:

```sh
:; curl https://build.l5d.io/linkerd2-proxy/latest.txt
```

The SHA256 sum of each package version is found at:

```sh
:; curl https://build.l5d.io/linkerd2-proxy/linkerd2-proxy-$PACKAGE_VERSION.txt
```
