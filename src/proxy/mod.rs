//! Reponsible for proxying traffic from a server interface.
//!
//! As the `Server` is invoked with transports, it may terminate a TLS session
//! and determine the peer's identity and determine whether the connection is
//! transporting HTTP. If the transport does not contain HTTP traffic, then the
//! TCP stream is blindly forwarded (according to the original socket's
//! `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` option). Otherwise, an HTTP service established for the
//! connection through which requests are dispatched.
//!
//! Once a request is routed, the `Client` type can be used to establish a
//! `Service` that hides the type differences between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 clients.
//!
//! This module is intended only to store the infrastructure for building a
//! proxy. The specific logic implemented by a proxy should live elsewhere.
