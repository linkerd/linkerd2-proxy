//! A client for the controller's Destination service.
//!
//! This client is split into two primary components: A `Resolver`, that routers use to
//! initiate service discovery for a given name, and a `background::Process` that
//! satisfies these resolution requests. These components are separated by a channel so
//! that the thread responsible for proxying data need not also do this administrative
//! work of communicating with the control plane.
//!
//! The number of active resolutions is not currently bounded by this module. Instead, we
//! trust that callers of `Resolver` enforce such a constraint (for example, via
//! `linkerd2_proxy_router`'s LRU cache). Additionally, users of this module must ensure
//! they consume resolutions as they are sent so that the response channels don't grow
//! without bounds.
//!
//! Furthermore, there are not currently any bounds on the number of endpoints that may be
//! returned for a single resolution. It is expected that the Destination service enforce
//! some reasonable upper bounds.
//!
//! ## TODO
//!
//! - Given that the underlying gRPC client has some max number of concurrent streams, we
//!   actually do have an upper bound on concurrent resolutions. This needs to be made
//!   more explicit.
//! - We need some means to limit the number of endpoints that can be returned for a
//!   single resolution so that `control::Cache` is not effectively unbounded.
