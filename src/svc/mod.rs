//! Infrastructure for proxying request-response message streams
//!
//! This module contains utilities for proxying request-response streams. This
//! module borrows (and re-exports) from `tower`.
//!
//! ## Clients
//!
//! A client is a `Service` through which the proxy may dispatch requests.
//!
//! In the proxy, there are currently two types of clients:
//!
//! - As the proxy routes requests to an outbound `Destination`, a client
//!   service is resolves the destination to and load balances requests
//!   over its endpoints.
//!
//! - As an outbound load balancer dispatches a request to an endpoint, or as
//!   the inbound proxy fowards an inbound request, a client service models an
//!   individual `SocketAddr`.
//!
//! ## TODO
//!
//! * Move HTTP-specific service infrastructure into `svc::http`.
