//! This crate provides an implementation of _meshtls_ backed by `boringssl` (as
//! provided by <https://github.com/cloudflare/boring>).
//!
//! There are several caveats with the current implementation:
//!
//! In its current form, this crate is compatible with the `meshtls-rustls`
//! implementation, which requires of ECDSA-P256-SHA256 keys & signature
//! algorithms. This crate doesn't actually constrain the algorithms beyond the
//! Mozilla's 'intermediate' (v5) [defaults][defaults]. But, the goal for
//! supporting `boring` is to provide a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode. There's a
//! [PR][fips-pr] that implements this, but code changes will likely be required
//! to enable this once it's merged/released.
//!
//! A new SSL context is created for each connection. This is probably
//! unnecessary, but it's simpler for now. We can revisit this if needed.
//!
//! This module is not enabled by default. See the `linkerd-meshtls` and
//! `linkerd2-proxy` crates for more information.
//!
