//! Facilities for HTTP/1.1 upgrades.
//!
//! See [RFC 9110 ยง 7.8][rfc9110] for more information about HTTP/1.1's `Upgrade` header field,
//! and how it is used to transition to other protocols like HTTP/2 on a particular connection.
//!
//! Note that HTTP/2 does *NOT* provide support for the `Upgrade` header field, per
//! [RFC 9113 ยง 8.6][rfc9113].
//!
//! > The semantics of `101 (Switching Protocols)` aren't applicable to a multiplexed protocol.
//!
//! Use [`Service::new()`] to add upgrade support to a [`tower::Service`].
