//! Facilities for HTTP/1.1 upgrades.
//!
//! HTTP/1.1 specifies an `Upgrade` header field that may be used in tandem with the `Connection`
//! header field as a simple mechanism to transition from HTTP/1.1 to another protocol. This crate
//! provides [`tower`] middleware that enable upgrades to HTTP/2 for services running within a
//! [`tokio`] runtime.
//!
//! Use [`Service::new()`] to add upgrade support to a [`tower::Service`].
//!
//! [RFC 9110 ยง 7.6.1][rfc9110-connection] for more information about the `Connection` header
//! field, [RFC 9110 ยง 7.8][rfc9110-upgrade] for more information about HTTP/1.1's `Upgrade`
//! header field, and [RFC 9110 ยง 15.2.2][rfc9110-101] for more information about the
//! `101 (Switching Protocols)` response status code.
//!
//! Note that HTTP/2 does *NOT* provide support for the `Upgrade` header field, per
//! [RFC 9113 ยง 8.6][rfc9113]. HTTP/2 is a multiplexed protocol, and connection upgrades are
//! thus inapplicable.
